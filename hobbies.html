								<p>I have a sufficient number of things that I like to do in my free time. My hobbies are as follows:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Programming</li>
									<li>Listening to music</li>
									<li>Reading books</li>
									<li>Painting</li>
								</ul>

							<h3><span class="material-symbols-outlined">code</span> Programming</h3>
							<p>As I said, I have some experience in programming in various programming languages and frameworks. I like to make projects, implement my ideas, solve problems and automate some processes. And if I get down to business, then I want to do it perfectly as much as I can.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text-block">
							<h3><span class="material-symbols-outlined">music_note</span> Music</h3>
							<p>I listen to music a lot of the time. I love different kinds of music despite their genre. Listening to music helps you concentrate on the task, calm down, set the pace and mood. My favorite genre of music is classical music.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text-block">
							<h3><span class="material-symbols-outlined">book_4</span> Books</h3>
							<p>Sometimes I like to read various books. I mostly like fiction. My favorite genre is science fiction. And my favorite authors at the moment are Kobo Abe, Stanislaw Lem, Alexander Belyaev, Boris and Arkady Strugatsky.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="text-block">
							<h3><span class="material-symbols-outlined">stylus_note</span> Drawing</h3>
							<p>Sometimes I like to draw. Despite my little experience in drawing, I can draw a lot of things. The process of drawing can also attract me into the process itself, as well as programming: I start thinking more ahead and try to design what I have planned, and then embellish what I have drawn.</p>
